Here is some multimedia from the paper “ Learning Accurate Representation to Nonstandard Tensors via a Mode-Aware Tucker Network” including the dataset, code for the MTN-TRL algorithm, and a supplementary file.

Note that MTN-SF.pdf is a supplementary file to this manuscript. Thank you for your access and reading.

Note that D1.txt is a dataset used in the manuscript. The four numerical values ​​in each row represent (i::j::k::value), where (i, j, k) represents the index in a tensor and "value" represents the value corresponding to this index.
